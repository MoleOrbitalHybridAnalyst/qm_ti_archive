# qm_ti_archive

Data and code archive for https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17002

pyscf: a copy of PySCF gas-phase examples were run with

A copy of GPU4PySCF solvated Lys and Asp were run with can be found here (https://github.com/MoleOrbitalHybridAnalyst/qmmm_archive/tree/main/gpu4pyscf)

old_data/: inputs and data of the archive paper. This was generated by my old scripts based on PySCF and GPU4PySCF before I implemented a systematic interface to generate quantum mechanical alchemical systems.

examples/: example inputs of using the new interface (https://github.com/MoleOrbitalHybridAnalyst/qalchemify/) to redo the simulations in old_data/
